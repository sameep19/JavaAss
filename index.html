               <p>As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.Selectors for 
                  Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal 
                  Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since 
                  childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in 
                  June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days 
                  after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two 
                  assists in their 8/0 victory.

               <p>Lionel Messi has won the award a record eight times, followed by Cristiano Ronaldo with five. Messi is the only player in 
                  history to win the award with three different teams and also the only one to win it while playing outside Europe.Three players
                  have won the award three times each: Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten. With seven awards each, Dutch, 
                  German, Portuguese and French players have won the second most Ballons d'Or, underneath Argentina in first with eight.

            <div class="accordion-panel">
               <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, 
                  and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and 
                  Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's 
                  side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for 
                  the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat√≠as, and his cousins, Maximiliano and 
                  Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers
